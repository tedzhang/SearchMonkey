PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 44.5 million French voters go to the polls on Sunday for the first round of the presidential election which is seen to be one of the least predictable in history. 

    Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. across the nation while the 12 candidates wait nervously to see which two of them will qualify for the second round on May 6. 

    Voting started in France's overseas territories a day earlier. 

    By Friday when campaigning stopped, opinion polls had put right-wing Nicolas Sarkozy in the lead. Socialist candidate Segolene Royal was in an immediate second place. 

    However, a "Sarko-Sego" showdown is not guaranteed as centrist Francois Bayrou, third in opinion polls, may turn out to be a black horse. 

    Far right veteran Jean-Marie Le Pen may be the only other strong contender for the second round. But his chances are generally believed to be smaller than in 2002 when he surprised the nation by making to the second round with Jacques Chirac. 

    The first results will be available by the time the polling stations close at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT). People should be prepared for any possibilities as millions of voters were still undecided by Friday. 

    This year's presidential poll represents transfer of power to a younger generation from Chirac as all the probable successors are all in their 50s.
